# MCSRHub

MCSR is such a diversified community of likeminded individuals. There are so many guides, resources, and tutorials out there, but it can take new runners hours of shifting through it to find exactly what they need. So, what if there was a unified hub with all the designated information to provide any runner (old and new alike) with quick references to specific tech and information?

## Open Source

Meant to be community driven, MCSR Hub allows for any one to contribute to make this site the most up-to-date with MCSR tech and resources.

## New Card Suggestions

If you want to add a new card, /dev/content allows you to see all the current cards and to add a new one. If you would like to get a resource added, message me on Discord `@jqhz` or create a pull request.

Enjoy resource hunting!
