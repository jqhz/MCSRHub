# MCSRHub
MCSR is such a diversified community of likeminded individuals. JavaCord has so many guides, resources, and tutorials out there, but it can take new runners hours of shifting through it to find exactly what they need. So, what if there was a unified hub with all the designated information to provide any runner (old and new alike) with quick references to specific tech and information.
